### Abstract

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. The dataset is ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).

While increasing the duration of the contact attempt in the campaign can stand to benefit a higher subscription rate, it will only do so slightly. Therefore, a revision model based on logistical regression is carried out to solve the overarching dilemma of targeted marketing to a select demographic, with 87% accuracy.
